        <h2>Who is eligible?</h2>
        <p>
          You need to be a high schooler (or younger). You just need a GitHub account & a Slack account to participate. Different prizes have different country restrictions.

        </p>
       
        <h2>What types of projects count?</h2>
        <p>
          Projects need to be open source (ie. linked to a GitHub repo) & have a way for people to experience it (ie. a game, a website, etc). At the end, each 'scrap' of your project will be put together in a timeline, so make sure to document your progress!
        </p>
        <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
        <p>
          100% free â€“ all the prizes are donated to us or paid for by us! Some shipments may have customs charges that we can't cover depending on your country.
        </p>
        <h2>My hours aren't counted!</h2>
        <p>
          We have human review on all your amazing work! Your 'scraps' may take a few days to review, but we'll get to it.
        </p>
        <h2>What about school work or a job?</h2>
        <p>
          The arcade is about the joy of building for the sake of building. If you're building something for school or work we can't count it.
        </p>
        <h2>What counts as a scrap?</h2>
        <p>
          Code needs a commit! Things like sprig or blot share links also work. 3D models should also go on a host like Printables or Github.
